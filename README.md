# Foodly-Viper

Techcareer.net iOS Developer Bootcamp Graduation Project

## About Project

Welcome to my graduation project. VIPER architecture was used for the development of this project. In my project the user can sign up and login to the app with firebase auth. In the app, foods from API are listed and food searches can be performed. We can add these foods to our cart. We can delete the products in our cart and change the product quantity. If we want to complete the order, you will be directed to the payment method, address selection, credit card information pages. After the payment is made, you can track the courier on the map.
